# ServletChallenge

1. Create a Maven war project and demonstrate to me a prototype login/session feature you can implement on Project 1. 

2. Create at least two servlets which will provide the user a login page and a landing page. 

3. The login page should have a form, while the landing page should only allow users who have successfully signed in to access or view its normal contents. 

4. If a user fails to login, he should be redirected back to the login page.
